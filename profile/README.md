### Emagjby Labs

Applied research and experimental engineering lab exploring systems software, programming languages, and developer infrastructure.

We build prototypes to test new ideas in runtimes, abstractions, and execution models, then harden the ones that prove useful.

---

### What we do:

Emagjby Labs focuses on work that sits between theory and production.

That includes:
- Programming languages and language tooling  
- Runtimes, execution models, and modular systems  
- Developer tooling and infrastructure  
- High-performance and systems-level software  

Most projects start as experiments. Some stay that way. A few will graduate into long-term systems.

---

### How we work:

Labs work differently than product teams.

- Research through implementation  
- Rapid prototyping over speculation  
- Small, composable systems  
- Strong preference for clarity, performance, and correctness  
- Willingness to discard ideas that don’t hold up  

If something survives multiple rewrites, it’s probably worth keeping.

### Projects:

Projects in this organization may be:
- **unstable**
- **incomplete**
- **opinionated**
- **intentionally minimal**

Each repository documents its own goals, status, and guarantees.

---

### Philosophy:

- Abstractions should earn their existence  
- Tooling should reduce cognitive load, not add to it  
- Performance is a feature  
- Simplicity scales better than cleverness  

We care more about foundations than features.

### Status:

_Emagjby Labs is an active research environment._
_Expect breaking changes, sharp edges, and unfinished ideas._
